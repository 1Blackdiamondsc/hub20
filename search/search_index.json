Its functionality is directly tied up with the Ethereum blockchain and we assume that the reader is aware of technical and security implications of operating this kind of system. For its proper operation, private keys of an Ethereum account are required by the system. DO NOT use this software with any key that holds any substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Introduction Hub20 is an open source, self-hosted web application that provides a wrapper for Ethereum and Raiden Network client nodes. It hides all of the complexity from end-users so that they can make and receive payments in ETH and any ERC20-compliant token using always the fastest/cheapest possible route without ever needing to know any technical detail. It also provides a set of APIs that effectively turn any deployment into a payment gateway for Ethereum tokens. In practice, one can think of each instance of Hub20 of a single \"crypto bank\" where users simply have access to their individual accounts and token balances, while the person running the deployment (hub operator or hub owner) is the one with actual access to the bank vault and funds. Features Direct, peer-to-peer payments for ETH and any ERC20-compliant token No transaction fees for transfers between accounts of the same instance Payments are always sent using the cheapest route possible Easy to integrate widget on third party sites, lets you accept ETH payments via blockchain or Raiden Pluggable architecture for managing Ethereum accounts: you can use standard keystore accounts, HD Wallets or implement your own method. No transaction fees for accepting payments No KYC Easy to extend and add modules - e.g, hub operators can aggregate user deposits and add liquidity to Decentralized Exchanges and possibly earning money for everyone Use Cases Hub20 can be used by individuals and businesses of any size and manage any amount of funds. Its focus however stays on providing easy to use functionality for small groups and communities whose peers know each other and already have established trust among themselves. E-commerce: easy to connect to websites and accept payments Banking and bookkeeping for marketplaces: if you run an online or physical marketplace, you can use Hub20 as a way to give each merchant and each customer an account which can then be used to manage their balances and payouts Small group banking: run an instance to manage expenses from your community club, keep track of house bills and split with housemates Investment cooperative: users with little knowledge of De-Fi can work together with the hub operator and invest their pooled resources Compared with existing payment gateways and exchanges Hub20 is only a software package that anyone can download, run and modify. It is up for the operators to decide how they are going to manage its instances and who they will let have accounts created on their system.","title":"Hub20 Documentation"},{"location":"#hub20-documentation","text":"This software is still in very early stage and not yet recommended to be run by non-developers.
